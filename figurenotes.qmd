# Fig1: Foundations of the model, environmental space

## Part 1
- Heat map for PCs
- Where do PCs load? 
- How can PCs be interpreted?

## Part 2
- Geo maps of all atolls and loadings on PC1 and PC2

# Fig2: Presentation of count model

- Parameters (omegas) by species, nestingtype for each PC

# Fig3: Presentation of presence model

- As fig2 but for presence

# FigX: Map of species occurence probability

# FigY: Geo map with density of species occurence (hist2d, using predictions from models)

- Visualize fraction of global population on different regions
