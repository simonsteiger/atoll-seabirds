Text about main findings

![](figures/figure_summary.svg)

## Workflow

This would be nice, but we did not go with a figure for this.
Drop or describe in text format?

## Installation

Make sure to run this in an environment that supports bash if you are on Windows, e.g., Git Bash.

```bash
chmod +x /path/to/repository/reproduce.sh # Make shell script executable
bash ./reproduce.sh /path/to/repository true true # Reproduce all scripts
```

### Note on ARGS 

- first arg is the path
- second arg is sampling from posterior (! requires locally saved chains)
- third arg is running LOO CV
